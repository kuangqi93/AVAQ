## Introduction
AVAQ6000 is a dataset used for Aerial Video Aesthetic Quality assessment. We collected 6,000 UAV video shots, including 3,000 professional shots and 3,000 amateur shots. The professional shots are collected from several documentaries and films. The amateur shots are downloaded from aerial video websites where amateurs can share their works with others. 

Each video is an individual shot. Additionally, to avoid the influence of the shot length, the duration time of each shot does not exceed 1 min. The total length of AVAQ6000 is more than 25 hours.
The resolution of videos is 720P or 1080P. The framerate is 30 fps.
